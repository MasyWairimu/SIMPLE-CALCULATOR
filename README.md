# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR

This is a simple project where I created a basic calculator using:-
    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. JAVASCRIPT
Th calculator has the addition, subtraction, multiplaction and division operations.
In addition it has the all clear and delete functionalities.

The main aim of the project is to familiarise with the three.
